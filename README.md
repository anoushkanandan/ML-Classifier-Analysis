# ML-Classifier-Analysis
The goal of this project is to give a comprehensive comparison of several machine learning classifiers. The study will compare the performance of well-known classifiers such as k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) on various datasets.
